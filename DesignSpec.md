## Problem Statement:
	
The problem we are attempting to solve is an inability for students and educators to create personalized learning environments in an interactive, fun, and exciting manner. From various interviews with K-12 students, many of them are typically placed in fixed environments where evaluating and practicing their skill of a topic comes in the form of standardized physical homework assignments from textbooks. Additional interviews show that although some K-12 schools are implementing online homework assignments as a tool to better stimulate student achievement, other schools continue to rely on physical textbook homework assignments to assist student learning. Furthermore, research shows that a combination of both textbook and online homework assignments increases student achievement (Liberatore). Also group learning environments demonstrate an increase of academic achievement as well (Johnson). Thus, we intend to directly address the lack of a flexible online resource for students that is capable of personalized learning environments that is both accessible, customizable, and easily shareable for the academic needs of the individual or group. 

In an interview with a local Seattle high school student, they mentioned that their math online learning environment was dull and lacked any incentive to complete more than what was required. This same student also indicated that some math sets that they completed were incredibly redundant and would have preferred to tailor the problems based on what skills they wanted to practice more. This student’s experience resonated with those of other university students where math platforms like WebAssign lack customization, student flexibility, and incentives. In these cases, current online platforms are incredibly rigid where students are unable to customize their learning environment outside of completing required problems from an instructor. Additional presented concerns from said students indicated that very few options for creating easily shareable and customizable academic practice tools existed. 

After conducting additional interviews with local Seattle students that had experience using online learning tools like Kahoot! and Quizlet, we found that most students found them either too difficult to get started with or not personalized enough for individualized learning. Students with experience using Kahoot! only found this tool most useful in personal classroom settings that although fun, did not personalize a learning environment dedicated to improving academic achievement. Interviewees with experience using Quizlet mentioned that although a popular tool, wasn’t easy to get started with. In this case, tools like Quizlet and Kahoot! may not be accessible to all students regardless of their proficiency with technology.

## Solution

### Screen #1

- The “Log in” button will lead the user to the corresponding login page (Screen 2) where they can input their credentials to access their problems sets and view their standing on the leaderboard. The presence of this button on middle of the landing page allows for users to easily navigate to the login page if they choose to.
- The “Create New Account” button leads to the account creation page (Screen 3) where new users can create accounts. This allows for new users to create problem sets, save them, and also put themselves on leaderboards after they have completed a problem set.
- In the middle of the page resides a large block of text that should introduce new users to the web application and what features it provides. This is an important feature that presents new users with core functionality of the web application. 
- The navigation bar holds a logo on the left that is not clickable. The “log in” and “create account” buttons lead to their respective pages as mentioned above. The “leaderboards” button leads to the leaderboards page on Screen 5. This navigation bar maybe contain duplicates with buttons already on the main landing page but serve as a consistent navigation tool regardless of what screen they are currently on
