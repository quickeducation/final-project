## Problem Statement:
Problem Statement:
The problem that we intend to tackle is an inability to personalize an environment where one can practice their skills in varying topics like Math or English in a fun, accessible, and exciting manner. More specifically, students are typically placed in fixed environments where evaluating and practicing their understanding of a topic comes in the form of standardized homework assignments and tests. While some students may find themselves adequately following along to course assignments, others require more assistance and time to hone their skills. This structure can result in many students finding themselves excelling in certain topics and struggling in others (Rosário et al.). Thus, these students are sometimes left to construct their own methods of improving without effective tools to do so. Some existing platforms such as Kahoot! are not always adequate enough and fail to personalize individual experiences, focusing primarily on making easy-to-use group-based quiz competitions.
